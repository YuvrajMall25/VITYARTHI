\# Problem Statement

Managing delivery orders manually can be inefficient, error-prone, and
difficult to track. There is a need for a simple, interactive system
that allows users to place orders, update delivery statuses, check order
details, and view all active deliveries in an organized way.

\# Scope of the Project

This project implements a command-line delivery service management
system using Python. It supports placing new delivery orders, updating
order statuses through predefined states, checking individual order
details by Order ID, and listing all orders. Data is stored in memory
for the session duration.

\# Target Users

\- Small delivery business operators looking for a simple order tracking
tool.

\- Students and beginners learning Python programming and basic data
management.

\- Users requiring a lightweight, terminal-based delivery tracking
solution.

\# High-Level Features

\- Place new delivery orders with customer details and delivery
information.

\- Update delivery statuses across stages: Preparing for delivery, Out
for delivery, Delivered.

\- Retrieve and display order details by entering Order ID.

\- Show a summary list of all current delivery orders with statuses.

\- Robust input handling with user-friendly menu navigation.

\- Automatic assignment of unique Order IDs for tracking.
