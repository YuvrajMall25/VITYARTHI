\# Simple Delivery Service Program\
\
\## Overview\
\
This Python program allows users to manage a simple delivery service via the command line. Users can place delivery orders, update delivery statuses, check order details, and list all current orders. The program stores all data in memory during runtime.\
\
\## Features\
\
\- Place new orders with customer name, item, and delivery address.\
\
\- Update order statuses: Preparing for delivery, Out for delivery, Delivered.\
\
\- Check details of a specific order by Order ID.\
\
\- View all orders with current statuses.\
\
\- Simple, interactive menu-driven interface.\
\
\## Requirements\
\
\- Python 3.x\
\
\- No external libraries needed.\
\
\## Getting Started\
\
1\. Save the program code as delivery\_service.py.\
\
2\. Open your terminal or command prompt.\
\
3\. Run the program:\
\
4\. Follow the menu prompts to interact with the delivery system.\
\
\## Usage Instructions\
\
\- Select \\*Place New Order\\* to add an order.\
\
\- Choose \\*Update Delivery Status\\* to change an order status.\
\
\- Use \\*Check Order Status\\* to view details of a specific order.\
\
\- Select \\*Show All Orders\\* to list all orders.\
\
\- Choose \\*Exit\\* to quit the program.\
\
\## Limitations\
\
\- Data is stored only in memory; all orders are lost when the program exits.\
\
\- Intended for demonstration and educational use.\
\
\## Future Improvements\
\
\- Implement persistent storage (e.g., database or file system).\
\
\- Add robust input validation and error handling.\
\
\- Extend functionality (e.g., delivery time estimates, user authentication).\
